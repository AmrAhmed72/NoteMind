## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.7.2 or higher)
- Dart SDK
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Note_Mind
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Generate Hive adapters:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
flutter run
```

### Android Permissions

For speech-to-text functionality, add the following to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

The scan feature also requests camera and photo access through `image_picker`.

### Gemini Configuration

Pass the key at build time instead of committing it to the app:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Production applications should call Gemini through a secure backend rather than
exposing a permanent API key inside the APK.

### iOS Permissions

For iOS, add the following to `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs microphone access to convert speech to text</string>
<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs speech recognition to convert your voice to text</string>
```
